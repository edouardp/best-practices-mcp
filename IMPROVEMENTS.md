# Python Best Practices Applied

This document summarizes the improvements made to align the repository with Python best practices from the documentation.

## ‚úÖ Implemented Improvements

### 1. Modern Project Structure
- **Added `pyproject.toml`** - Replaced old `requirements.txt` with modern PEP 621 configuration
- **Implemented src/ layout** - Moved code to `src/sdlc_mcp/` to prevent implicit imports
- **Added proper package structure** - Created `__init__.py` files and proper module organization

### 2. Tooling & Configuration
- **uv for dependency management** - Fast, modern alternative to pip with lockfile support
- **ruff for linting and formatting** - Rust-based tool combining flake8, isort, black
- **mypy with strict mode** - Static type checking with maximum safety
- **pytest configuration** - Proper test structure with AAA pattern and coverage

### 3. Code Quality
- **Added comprehensive type hints** - All public functions and classes have proper typing
- **Fixed all linting issues** - Code passes ruff checks with strict rules
- **Reduced complexity** - Refactored functions to meet complexity limits
- **Consistent formatting** - Applied ruff formatting throughout codebase

### 4. Development Workflow
- **Pre-commit hooks** - Automated quality checks before commits
- **Makefile** - Common development tasks (install, lint, format, test, build)
- **Proper .gitignore** - Comprehensive Python patterns including modern tools

### 5. Docker Modernization
- **Python 3.13** - Latest Python version with performance improvements
- **uv in Docker** - Faster dependency installation in containers
- **Module execution** - Using `python -m` for proper package execution

## üìä Quality Metrics

- **Linting**: ‚úÖ All ruff checks pass
- **Type checking**: ‚úÖ mypy strict mode passes
- **Code formatting**: ‚úÖ Consistent ruff formatting applied
- **Project structure**: ‚úÖ Modern src/ layout implemented

## üöÄ Key Benefits

1. **Faster development** - uv is 10-100x faster than pip
2. **Better code quality** - Strict type checking and linting catch bugs early
3. **Consistent formatting** - Automated code formatting reduces review overhead
4. **Reproducible builds** - Lockfiles ensure identical dependencies across environments
5. **Modern tooling** - Using latest Python ecosystem best practices

## üìù Configuration Files Added

- `pyproject.toml` - Modern Python project configuration
- `.pre-commit-config.yaml` - Automated quality checks
- `Makefile` - Development task automation
- `tests/` - Proper test structure with pytest

## üîß Commands Available

```bash
# Development setup
make setup

# Quality checks
make lint      # Run linting
make format    # Format code
make test      # Run tests
make check     # Run all quality checks

# Build
make build     # Build Docker image
make clean     # Clean up artifacts
```

## üìö Alignment with Best Practices

This implementation follows the Python best practices documented in `PYTHON_BEST_PRACTICES.md`:

- ‚úÖ Python 3.13 with pinned versions
- ‚úÖ uv for dependency management
- ‚úÖ ruff for linting and formatting
- ‚úÖ mypy with strict mode
- ‚úÖ pytest with proper configuration
- ‚úÖ src/ layout for proper imports
- ‚úÖ Pre-commit hooks for quality gates
- ‚úÖ Type hints on public interfaces
- ‚úÖ Modern pyproject.toml configuration

The codebase now represents a production-ready Python project following current ecosystem best practices.
